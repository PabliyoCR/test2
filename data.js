  You have an Azure subscription that uses Microsoft Defender XDR.
  
  From the Microsoft Defender portal, you perform an audit search and export the results as a file named Filel.csv that contains 10,000 rows.
  
  You use Microsoft Excel to perform Get & Transform Data operations to parse the AuditData column from Filel.csv. The operations fail to generate columns for specific JSON properties.
  
  You need to ensure that Excel generates columns for the specific JSON properties in the audit search results.
  
  Solution: From Excel, you apply filters to the existing columns in Filel.csv to reduce the number of rows, and then you perform the Get & Transform Data operations to parse the AuditData column.
  
  Does this meet the requirement?
  
  Options:
  AYes
  BNo
